# brain_tumor_detection
This project demonstrate the three pretrained models : VGG16, ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3 for the detection of brain tumor through MRI scan images.
The model which performed the best among the 3 is ResNet50. It gave training accuracy of 99% and test accuracy of 96% and precision around 98%.
The frontend is made using React.js + Tailwindcss for easy usage and entirely responsive site.
For the backend part , we used Flask to generate url to connect backend and frontend of the project.
